Question - Were you able to use the SSH to connect to both instances? Why or why not?

Answer: If you were not able to connect to instance A, it was due to this instance being assigned only a private IP address. Private IP addresses cannot be accessed from outside the VPC. This is why you are only able to connect to instance B. Instance B has a public IP address assigned to it allowing access from outside the VPC, which allows you to use the SSH utility to connect to the instance.
