# Internet Protocols - Static and Dynamic Addresses
 

## Scenario
Your role is a cloud support engineer at Amazon Web Services (AWS). During your shift, a customer from a Fortune 500 company requests assistance regarding a networking issue within their AWS infrastructure. The email and an attachment of their architecture is below:

## Ticket from your customer
*Hello Cloud Support!

We are having issues with one of our EC2 instances. The IP changes every time we start and stop this instance called Public Instance. This causes everything to break since it needs a static IP address. We are not sure why the IP changes on this instance to a random IP every time. Can you please investigate? Attached is our architecture. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
Bob, Cloud Admin*

## Architecture diagram

test instance 
Public IPv4 address 35.87.238.192  after stoping and starting: 34.219.183.26
Private IPv4 addresses  10.0.10.15 " 10.0.10.15

## ELASTIC IP ADDRESS
Allocated IPv4 address 52.88.200.85 **Type** Public IP

TEST INSTANCE IP AFTER ASSOCIATON: 52.88.200.85

Did you notice that the EIP address is now the Public IP address? Now stop and start the instance and observe the differences. What did you observe? Is this a static or dynamic IP address? Did you solve the customer's issue? Why or why not?
