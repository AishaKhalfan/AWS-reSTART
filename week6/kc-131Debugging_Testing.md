# 131-[PF]-KC - Debugging and Testing

- What is an efficient way to find and fix errors in a running application?
	- [ ] Log as many messages as possible in files.
	- [ ] Use the print() method to display how the application is running.
	- [ ] Use a debugging tool for static analysis.
	- [x] Use a debugging tool for dynamic analysis.

- What are the advantages of performing static code analysis instead of dynamic analysis? (Select TWO.)
	- [x] Bugs can be detected early in the development process.
	- [x] The exact location of code issues can be identified.
	- [ ] It can be done at runtime.
	- [ ] Compiled applications can be reviewed even if code is not accessible.
	- [ ] It offers a step-by-step analysis of the code runtime.

- What is the purpose of assertions?
	- [x] To raise errors under certain conditions at runtime
	- [ ] To log a message when an issue occurs
	- [ ] To provide a method for writing if statements in a different way
	- [ ] To provide optimization techniques so that code runs faster

- Which type of test is the smallest testable part of application?
	- [ ] Integration tests
	- [x] Unit tests
	- [ ] System tests
	- [ ] Acceptance tests

- What kind of test can verify that the different part of software will work together or not when combined?
	- [x] Integration tests
	- [ ] Unit test
	- [ ] System tests
	- [ ] Acceptance tests
